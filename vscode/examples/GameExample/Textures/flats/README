This directory contains the flats (floor and ceiling textures). More
information about flats can be found on the Doom wiki:

    <http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Flat>

GIF files placed in this directory will not be automatically included
in the build; the lump name must also be added into buildcfg.txt in
the top-level directory in the section named [flats].
