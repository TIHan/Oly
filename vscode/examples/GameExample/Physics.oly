//The simulation has a variety of extension points that must be defined. 
//The demos tend to reuse a few types like the DemoNarrowPhaseCallbacks, but this demo will provide its own (super simple) versions.
//If you're wondering why the callbacks are interface implementing structs rather than classes or events, it's because 
//the compiler can specialize the implementation using the compile time type information. That avoids dispatch overhead associated
//with delegates or virtual dispatch and allows inlining, which is valuable for extremely high frequency logic like contact callbacks.
