# Oly
Oly Language Compiler and Runtime

A side project to understand programming languages and compilers in all stages.

**Note: At the moment, documentation is in progress on building the project and language specification. It will come eventually.**

## How to Build

In the command-line and at the root directory of the repository, run commands:

`dotnet build` - for Debug
`dotnet build -c Release` - for Release

This will build everything except for the VSCode extension.

You can also open `Oly.sln` in Visual Studio and build it there.
